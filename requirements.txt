😴 Sleep Disorder Prediction App
📊 Predict sleep disorders like Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, or Parasomnia using health and lifestyle features. Built with SVM Classifier (best model) and deployed as a Streamlit web app.

🌐 Streamlit App
Predict your risk of sleep disorders by entering simple lifestyle and health details like sleep duration, stress level, and more.

🧠 Overview
This project uses Supervised Machine Learning to identify potential sleep disorders from health records.
The model is trained on a cleaned and preprocessed version of the Sleep Health dataset.
With an SVM model providing strong accuracy and generalization, the web interface is interactive and user-friendly for health analysis and predictions.
