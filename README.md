Sleep Disorder Prediction App
Predict sleep disorders like Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, or Parasomnia using health and lifestyle features. Built with SVM Classifier (best model) and deployed as a Streamlit web app.
Streamlit App
Predict your risk of sleep disorders by entering simple lifestyle and health details like sleep duration, stress level, and more.

Overview
This project uses Supervised Machine Learning to identify potential sleep disorders from health records.
The model is trained on a cleaned and preprocessed version of the Sleep Health dataset.
With an SVM model providing strong accuracy and generalization, the web interface is interactive and user-friendly for health analysis and predictions.
